# RomCom Partner Paired Project

RomCom is a website that allows users to generate random romance novel covers.
Users can generate random romance novel covers and create their own covers. The
user can create their own romance novel cover by clicking the `Make Your Own Cover`
button. Users can save the displayed random covers or their own created
covers. These covers can be viewed on the saved covers page by clicking the
`View Saved Covers` button. Duplicate romance novel covers will not be saved.
Users can return to the home view by clicking the `Home` button.
